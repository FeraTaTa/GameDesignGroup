Once you launch the game you are presented with a menu, to navigate please use the arrow up/down keys and space bar to select. Options bring up a panel but it is currently empty, to escape the panel hit the space bar again.

Use WASD to move up/left/down/right 
Character facing is controlled by the mouse position and LEFT CLICK to perform the basic attack.

Falling off the platform will hurt you!

Slimes will die to 1 hit
Robots will die to 2 hits
The big demons will die to 5 hits shared between them.

Items are picked up by coming close enough to pick them up.

The objective is to complete the level by solving the puzzle to then gain access to the boss room and defeat the demons. 

(SPOILER)
You need to pick up the red gem and take it to the red dragon stone and then pick up the blue gem and take it to the blue unicorn stone. This triggers the boss room gate to open and you are able to enter and kill the demons. 

At this point the demo actually ends since the final gate doesn't open to allow progress, nor does the game detect it is successfully completed, nor does the game end when the player actually loses enough health to die.

The only way to exit the game at this point is via Alt-F4
